# Diversify

## The Project

Diversify is a playlist generator based on the [Spofity WEB API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and the [Spotipy module](http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
that aims to use concepts of AI to suggest playlists based on musical preferences between multiple people.

This project was heavily inspired by this [article](https://dev.to/ericbonfadini/finding-my-new-favorite-song-on-spotify-4lgc) by 
[@ericbonfadini](https://twitter.com/ericbonfadini) and it's basically just an extra functionality in his analysis.

## Goals

The goal is to use AI algorithms to generate a spotify playlist based on a user's preference and
a friend of his choice. Currently the script will use a genetic algorthm to generate the playlists
but this may improve in the future.
